It was a vey fun project to make and very chanlleging as well, since the documentation on Angular Universal was oudated and no one had an answer on how to use third-party libraries with Angular Universal (SSR - Server Side Rendering) since it's required to deploy applications and window object doesn't exist on server side. But I did manage to find a way.
